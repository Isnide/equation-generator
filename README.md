# Equation Generator

This projet is an equation generator that allow to create equations with different discriminant (square and positive, positive and not square (and inferior to 100), and negative). So there are three different generator for each 'type' of discriminant. 

to understant the program, here the formula to find discriminant :  Δ=b² - 4ac
and the three cases needed to build the training for maths : 

- case 1 : Δ > 0 and squared (ex: x² + 5x + 4, discriminant is 9) 
- case 2 : Δ > 0  and not squared (ex : x² + 5x + 5, discriminant is 5)
- case 3 : Δ < 0 (x² + 2x + 8, discriminant is -28)


## Features

- Generation of equations with different 'types' of discriminants.
- Validation of user responses.
- Display of appropriate messages based on user response.


## To use it : 

Run 'main.py' and you'll have  to answer the question "Trouve le discriminant de x équation" and if you don't answer correctly, the program will give you the right answer.
